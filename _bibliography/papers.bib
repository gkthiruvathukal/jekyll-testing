abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) are successful in many computer vision tasks. However, the most accurate DNNs require millions of parameters and operations, making them energy, computation and memory intensive. This impedes the deployment of large DNNs in low-power devices with limited compute resources. Recent research improves DNN models by reducing the memory requirement, energy consumption, and number of operations without significantly decreasing the accuracy. This paper surveys the progress of low-power deep learning and computer vision, specifically in regards to inference, and discusses the methods for compacting and accelerating DNN models. The techniques can be divided into four major categories: (1) parameter quantization and pruning, (2) compressed convolutional filters and matrix factorization, (3) network architecture search, and (4) knowledge distillation. We analyze the accuracy, advantages, disadvantages, and potential solutions to the problems with the techniques in each category. We also discuss new evaluation metrics as a guideline for future research.},

abstract={In the blooming era of smart edge devices, surveillance cameras have been deployed in many locations. Surveillance cameras are most useful when they are spaced out to maximize coverage of an area. However, deciding where to place cameras is an NP-hard problem and researchers have proposed heuristic solutions. Existing work does not consider a significant restriction of computer vision: in order to track a moving object, the object must occupy enough pixels. The number of pixels depends on many factors (How far away is the object? What is the camera resolution? What is the focal length?). In this study, we propose a camera placement method that identifies effective camera placement in arbitrary spaces and can account for different camera types as well. Our strategy represents spaces as polygons, then uses a greedy algorithm to partition the polygons and determine the cameras’ locations to provide the desired coverage. Our solution also makes it possible to perform object tracking via overlapping camera placement. Our method is evaluated against complex shapes and real-world museum floor plans, achieving up to 85% coverage and 25% overlap.},

pages={42-50},
abstract={Most of the existing video storage systems rely on offline processing to support the feature-based indexing on video streams. The feature-based indexing technique provides an effective way for users to search video content through visual features, such as object categories (e.g., cars and persons). However, due to the reliance on offline processing, video streams along with their captured features cannot be searchable immediately after video streams are recorded. According to our investigation, buffering and storing live video steams are more time-consuming than the YOLO v3 object detector. Such observation motivates us to propose a real-time feature indexing (RTFI) system to enable instantaneous feature-based indexing on live video streams after video streams are captured and processed through object detectors. RTFI achieves its real-time goal via incorporating the novel design of metadata structure and data placement, the capability of modern object detector (i.e., YOLO v3), and the deduplication techniques to avoid storing repetitive video content. Notably, RTFI is the first system design for realizing real-time feature-based indexing on live video streams. RTFI is implemented on a Linux server and can improve the system throughput by upto 10.60x, compared with the base system without the proposed design. In addition, RTFI is able to make the video content searchable within 20 milliseconds for 10 live video streams after the video content is received by the proposed system, excluding the network transfer latency.},

abstract={We present FLIC, a distributed software data caching framework for fogs that reduces network traffic and latency. FLIC is targeted toward city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT devices in which each node gathers and shares data with surrounding devices. As machine learning and other data processing techniques that require large volumes of training data are ported to low-cost and low-power IoT systems, we expect that data analysis will be moved away from the cloud. Separation from the cloud will reduce reliance on power-hungry centralized cloud-based infrastructure. However, city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT devices often connect to the Internet with cellular service, in which service charges are proportional to network usage. IoT system architects must be clever in order to keep costs down in these scenarios. To reduce the network bandwidth required to operate city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT systems, FLIC implements a distributed cache on the IoT nodes in the fog. FLIC allows the IoT network to share its data without repetitively interacting with a simple cloud storage service, reducing calls out to a backing store. Our results displayed a less than 2% miss rate on reads. Thus, allowing for only 5% of requests needing the backing store. We were also able to achieve more than 50% reduction in bytes transmitted per second.},

abstract={Even though computational reproducibility is widely accepted as necessary for research validation and reuse, it is often not considered during the research process. This is because reproducibility tools are typically stand-alone and require additional training to be employed. In this article, we present a solution to foster reproducibility, which is integrated within existing scientific software that is actively used in the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) collaboration. Our provenance tracking service captures metadata of a dataset, which is then saved inside the output data file on the disk. The captured information allows a complete understanding of how the file was produced and enables a user to reproduce the dataset, even when the original input code (that was used to initially produce the dataset) is altered or lost. This article describes the implementation of the service and gives examples of its application.},

abstract={In a new effort to make our research transparent and reproducible by others, we developed a workflow to run and share computational studies on the public cloud Microsoft Azure. It uses Docker containers to create an image of the application software stack. We also adopt several tools that facilitate creating and managing virtual machines on compute nodes and submitting jobs to these nodes. The configuration files for these tools are part of an expanded “reproducibility package” that includes workflow definitions for cloud computing, in addition to input files and instructions. This facilitates recreating the cloud environment to rerun the computations under the same conditions. Although cloud providers have improved their offerings, many researchers using high-performance computing (HPC) are still skeptical about cloud computing. Thus, we ran benchmarks for tightly coupled applications to confirm that the latest HPC nodes of Microsoft Azure are indeed a viable alternative to traditional on-site HPC clusters. We also show that cloud offerings are now adequate to complete computational fluid dynamics studies with in-house research software that uses parallel computing with GPUs. Finally, we share with the community what we have learned from nearly two years of using Azure cloud to enhance the transparency and reproducibility in our computational simulations.},

abstract={Computer vision relies on labeled datasets for training and evaluation in detecting and recognizing objects. The popular computer vision program, YOLO ("You Only Look Once"), has been shown to accurately detect objects in many major image datasets. However, the images found in those datasets, are independent of one another and cannot be used to test YOLO's consistency at detecting the same object as its environment (e.g. ambient lighting) changes. This paper describes a novel effort to evaluate YOLO's consistency for large-scale applications. It does so by working (a) at large scale and (b) by using consecutive images from a curated network of public video cameras deployed in a variety of real-world situations, including traf?c intersections, national parks, shopping malls, university campuses, etc. We speci?cally examine YOLO's ability to detect objects in different scenarios (e.g., daytime vs. night), leveraging the cameras' ability to rapidly retrieve many successive images for evaluating detection consistency. Using our camera network and advanced computing resources (supercomputers), we analyzedmorethan5millionimagescapturedby140network cameras in 24 hours. Compared with labels marked by humans (considered as "ground truth"), YOLO struggles to consistently detect the same humans and cars as their positions change from one frame to the next; it also struggles to detect objects at night time. Our ?ndings suggest that state-of-the art vision solutions should be trained by data from network camera with contextual information before they can be deployed in applications that demand high consistency on object detection.},

Analyzing the massive data generated by these cameras requires significant computational resources and the demands may vary over time. Cloud computing shows the most promise to provide the needed resources on demand. In this paper, we investigate how to allocate cloud resources when analyzing real-time data streams from network cameras. A resource manager considers many factors that affect its decisions, including the types of analysis, the number of data streams, and the locations of the cameras. The manager then selects the most cost-efficient types of cloud instances (e.g., central processing unit versus general-purpose graphics processing units) to meet the computational demands for analyzing streams. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using Amazon Web Services. Experiments demonstrate more than 50% cost reduction for real workloads.},

abstract={Background: Breakthroughs in research increasingly depend on complex software libraries, tools, and applications aimed at supporting specific science, engineering, business, or humanities disciplines. The complexity and criticality of this software motivate the need for ensuring quality and reliability. Software metrics are a key tool for assessing, measuring, and understanding software quality and reliability. Aims: The goal of this work is to better understand how research software developers use traditional software engineering concepts, like metrics, to support and evaluate both the software and the software development process. One key aspect of this goal is to identify how the set of metrics relevant to research software corresponds to the metrics commonly used in traditional software engineering. Method: We surveyed research software developers to gather information about their knowledge and use of code metrics and software process metrics. We also analyzed the influence of demographics (project size, development role, and development stage) on these metrics. Results: The survey results, from 129 respondents, indicate that respondents have a general knowledge of metrics. However, their knowledge of specific SE metrics is lacking, their use even more limited. The most used metrics relate to performance and testing. Even though code complexity often poses a significant challenge to research software development, respondents did not indicate much use of code metrics. Conclusions: Research software developers appear to be interested and see some value in software metrics but may be encountering roadblocks when trying to use them. Further study is needed to determine the extent to which these metrics could provide value in continuous process improvement.},

abstract={Millions of network cameras are streaming real-time multimedia content (images or videos) for various environments (e.g., highways and malls) and can be used for a variety of applications. Analyzing the content from many network cameras requires significant amounts of computing resources. Cloud vendors offer resources in the form of cloud instances with different capabilities and hourly costs. Some instances include GPUs that can accelerate analysis programs. Doing so incurs additional monetary cost because instances with GPUs are more expensive. It is a challenging problem to reduce the overall monetary cost of using the cloud to analyze the real-time multimedia content from network cameras while meeting the desired analysis frame rates. This paper describes a cloud resource manager that solves this problem by estimating the resource requirements of executing analysis programs using CPU or GPU, formulating the resource allocation problem as a multiple-choice vector bin packing problem, and solving it using an existing algorithm. The experiments show that the manager can reduce up to 61% of the cost compared with other allocation strategies.},

Current and near-term industrial systems employ multiple interacting components and new network and security approaches; hence, academic preparation requires teaching students to develop realistic projects comparable to these real-world products. However, the complexity, breadth, and technical variations of these real-world products are difficult to reproduce in the classroom. This paper outlines preliminary work on a framework architecture suitable for academic teaching of modern embedded systems including the Internet of Things. It defines four layers, two of which are at the edges of the network, and not adequately covered in academia. For each layer of the architecture, specific technology and suitable devices are identified. Desired academic outcomes for courses using projects based on the architecture are identified. Feedback and comparison is sought on how effective student course and research activities based on the framework will be to real-world embedded systems developers.},

abstract={Transparent access to remote data sets and data arising from web services is a non-trivial challenge to application developers. This early stage work addresses this challenge with NOFS, an object-oriented framework for creating filesystems to support domain specific functionality. While an early stage work, we present a solution to solve the access problem. Our solution greatly simplifies the task of filesystems development by providing the glue code needed between a domain model and the filesystem contract. We demonstrate support for domain models that are larger than physical memory and demonstrate how the concerns of caching can be removed from user-mode filesystem implementations. Future work will addresses more robust solutions to caching and other performance strategies.},

abstract={We present a novel form of intra-volume directory layering with hierarchical, inheritance-like namespace unification. While each layer of an OLFS volume constitutes a subvolume that can be mounted separately in a fan-in configuration, the entire hierarchy is always accessible (online) and fully navigable through any mounted layer. OLFS uses a relational database to store its layering metadata and either a relational database or any (virtual) host file system as its backing store, along with metadata and block caching for improved performance. Because OLFS runs as a virtual file system in user-space, its capabilities are available to all existing software without modification or special privileges. We have developed a reference implementation of OLFS for FUSE based on MySQL and XFS, and conducted performance benchmarking against XFS by itself. We explore several applications of OLFS, such as enhanced server synchronization, transactional file operations, and versioning.},

abstract={The fun all began in May of 1999, when VMware launched VMware Workstation, a product that lets you run multiple operating systems simultaneously on your desktop computer. In truth, the story begins much earlier with the VM OS concept, which was pioneered (like many things) by IBM in 1960 but eventually perfected by others. The idea behind virtualization is simple. You can run multiple OSs simultaneously and share the CPU, memory, and peripherals among them. In this article, we're not going to cover what virtualization is per se. This would easily require two articles, and the actual ideas behind virtualization are well explained elsewhere. And besides, we've already covered the use of virtualization in this column for use in maintaining experimental computing laboratories. Instead, we'll focus here on a fairly simple use case that's likely to be of interest to our readers: setting up your own mini compute cluster to use for developing and testing high-performance computing applications.},

abstract={This second installment picks up where Konrad Hinsen's article "The Promises of Functional Programming" from the July/August 2009 issue left off, covering static type inference and lazy evaluation in functional programming languages. In the first installment in this series on functional programming, Konrad Hinsen introduced the functional programming paradigm, which encourages recursion and higher-order functional abstraction in algorithms. In this second installment, we explore several other aspects of the functional paradigm. Using examples in the Closure, Java, and Haskell languages, we discuss some of the benefits of static typing with type inference and pure, side-effect-free functional programming with lazy evaluation. In particular, we argue that these features make Haskell a compelling choice for general software development. The scientific computing community, however, likely require better numeric library support and efficient functional versions of scientific algorithms before accepting Haskell more widely.},

year={2008},
volume={},
number={},
pages={488-493},
abstract={Processing markup in object-oriented languages often requires the programmer to focus on the objects generating the markup rather than the more pertinent domain objects. The BetterXML framework aims to improve this situation by allowing the programmer to develop a domain-specific object model as usual and later bind this model to preexisting or newly generated markup. To this end, the framework provides two types of object trees, XElement and NaturalXML, for representing XML documents. XElement goes beyond DOM-like automatic parsing of XML by supporting the custom mapping of elements to domain objects; NaturalXML allows the mapping of existing domain objects to XML elements using class metadata. Both types of object trees can be inflated and deflated by means of a common intermediate representation in the form of an event stream. Finally, the framework includes the XML Intermediate Representation (XIR), a lossless record-oriented representation of XML documents for efficient streaming and other types of data exchange.},

abstract={Scalable atomic and parallel access to noncontiguous regions of a file is essential to exploit high performance I/O as required by large-scale applications. Parallel I/O frameworks such as MPI I/O conceptually allow I/O to be defined on regions of a file using derived datatypes. Access to regions of a file can be automatically computed on a perprocessor basis using the datatype, resulting in a list of (offset, length) pairs. We describe three approaches for implementing lock serving (whole file, region locking, and byterange locking) and compare the various approaches using three noncontiguous I/O benchmarks. We present the details of the lock server architecture and describe the implementation of a fully-functional prototype that makes use of a lightweight message passing library and red/black trees.},

Atomicity has been well studied at the file system level, such as POSIX standard. We investigate the problems arising from the implementation of MPI atomicity for concurrent overlapping write access and provide two programming solutions. Since the MPI definition of atomicity differs from the POSIX one, an implementation that simply relies on the POSIX file systems does not guarantee correct MPI semantics. To have a correct implementation of atomic I/O in MPI, we examine the efficiency of three approaches: I) file locking, 2) graph-coloring, and 3) process-rank ordering. Performance complexity for these methods are analyzed and their experimental results are presented for file systems including NFS, SGI's XFS, and IBM's GPFS},

abstract={Java's early history explains its lure to this day. Java is alive and well, running on just about every computing platform, from handhelds to high-end servers such as multiprocessors. Implementations of Java for Windows, Macintosh (including OS X), and Linux have all reached sufficient maturity and are in widespread use. Performance and resource usage remain a problem in most Java implementations, but the language is improving all the time. In this article, I examine the lure of Java for computational science, discuss the Java Grande effort to work with Sun, and identify areas for improvement. I focus on language and implementation issues that must be solved for Java to be taken seriously for computationally focused codes. As a motivational tool, I include a number of reflections on the C# language from Microsoft, which many claim is nothing more than Java with a new syntax. I excise a number of sections from the specification documentation to demonstrate that specific Java Grande Forum (JGF) recommendations are implemented in the current version of Microsoft's C#. What is particularly interesting (but not necessarily verifiable) is that language appearing in the Microsoft C# specification proper often appears to paraphrase similar points raised in the JGF documents available at www.javagrande.org.},

abstract={Large-scale scientific applications present great challenges to computational scientists in terms of obtaining high performance and in managing large datasets. These applications (most of which are simulations) may employ multiple techniques and resources in a heterogeneously distributed environment. Effective working in such an environment is crucial for modern large-scale simulations. In this paper, we present an integrated Java graphical user interface (IJ-GUI) that provides a control platform for managing complex programs and their large datasets easily. As far as performance is concerned, we present and evaluate our initial implementation of two optimization schemes: data replication and data prediction. Data replication can take advantage of 'temporal locality' by caching the remote datasets on local disks; data prediction, on the other hand, provides prefetch hints based on the datasets' past activities that are kept in databases. We first introduce the data contiguity concept in such an environment that guides data prediction. The relationship between the two approaches is discussed.},

abstract={Heterogeneously distributed and parallel computing environments are highly dependent on hardware, data migration, and protocols. The result is significant difficulty in software reuse, portability across platforms, and an increased overall development effort. The appearance of a shared directory of unordered queues can be provided by integrating heterogeneous computers transparently. This integration provides a conducive environment for parallel and distributed application development, by abstracting the issues of hardware and communication. Object oriented technology is exploited to provide this seamless environment.},

abstract={Welcome to the 2nd annual RESPECT conference, which is co-located with the 11th annual STARS Celebration. Inspired by the Computer Science For All initiative, our theme of “CS += All”, is a programming notation that gives the instruction to add the contents of the variable “All” to the current value of the variable “CS”. In other words, we want to increase the value of computing by providing access to computing education for all people. This theme grows from our belief that the engagement of diverse people in computing is a matter of equity - all people deserve the opportunity to engage in work that is both lucrative and integral to solving increasingly complex global challenges. We hope that the RESPECT conference will inspire you to continue to increase diversity, promote an inclusive culture, and break down barriers for equity in computing.},

The plethora of options includes Red Hat, Lindows, Debian, SuSe, Mandrake, Gen-too, and even the emerging Chinese standard, Red Flag. Gentoo Linux is a significant distro for several reasons. First, the entire OS is maintained from source code. Even when binary packages are directly installed, metadata shows precisely how the package was configured and built. Second, we need install the OS only once. We can get upgrades of the latest packages from one of the myriad Gentoo mirrors. Finally, it's completely free, regardless of intended use and configuration. Unlike Red Hat Linux, Gentoo Linux doesn't have a commercial edition, meaning users don't have to worry that something might be missing in the free version. This paper looks at some of Gentoo's salient features.},

abstract={This paper looks at Plone, one of the best content management systems. Plone is distributed under a free open-source license: the cost of getting started is only limited to the time you have available to set up the software on a server. Plone is written in Python and uses the Zope application server infrastructure; it runs on most modern operating systems. Plone can be customized for the maintenance of content - entirely over the Web.},
