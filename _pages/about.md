Hi! I’m George K. Thiruvathukal.
I’m professor of computer science at Loyola University Chicago and visiting faculty at Argonne National Laboratory.

I earned the PhD and MS degrees in computer science from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1995 and 1990, respectively, and BA in computer science and physics (double major) with a mathematics minor from Lewis University in 1988.
As a computer science major, I received the department's top computer science graduating student award and was inducted into the [Sigma Pi Sigma](https://www.sigmapisigma.org>) Physics national honor society.

My primary research training is in the areas of high-performance computing, distributed systems, and software engineering with an emphasis on techniques to support parallel and distributed programming using modern software engineering practices, languages, and paradigms (e.g. object-oriented design and functional programming).

My doctoral research focused on object-oriented approaches to parallel programming and the development of object models, languages, libraries, middleware, and tools for parallel programming, which incorporated elements of dataflow computing, actors, and computational agents, resulting in several research prototypes written in the C and C++ languages on Unix platforms.
After completing and defending my disseration, I re-implemented many of the ideas from my dissertation in the Java programming language, which resulted in a book, *High-Performance Java Platform Computing*, Prentice Hall and Sun Microsystems Press in the *Java Series*, which was cited in the Java Specification Request, JSR-166 (Concurrency Utilities) as a related/existing work.
Our book, while no longer in print, is available freely and openly at [works.bepress.com/gkthiruvathukal/26/](https://works.bepress.com/gkthiruvathukal/26/).

Beyond my PhD training, I have wide-ranging interests in and beyond computer science, including cyber-physical systems, history of computing, computational and data science (applied to science and humanities problems), computing education, broadening participation, and social/societal issues in computing.
In recent years, I have been following the path of many computer scientists by adding machine learning and artificial intelligence to the mix.

During my copious free time, I study jazz improvision and solo/ensemble performance at Old Town School of Folk Music with [Jack Cassidy](https://www.jackcassidymusic.com/) I also enjoy cooking and baking with my family, which is truly a common bond for all of us!

My research is and has been funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, DARPA, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
I have also received corporate support from Hostway Corporation in Chicago, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, Typesafe, and Google Research (awarded to me and Yung-Hsiang Lu at Purdue in the area of machine perception).
